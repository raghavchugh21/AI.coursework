# EDGE WEIGHT PREDICTION

**OVERVIEW**

In this project, we perform edge weight detection in a weighted signed network, specifically a social signed network using Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm.

**INTRODUCTION**

Weighted signed networks (WSNs) are networks in which edges are labeled with positive and negative weights. WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks.
